# OpenCV License Plate Detection

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV in Python to detect and highlight a license plate in an image by drawing a rectangle and adding overlay text with a semi-transparent background.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

Install OpenCV using:
```bash
 pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage
 - Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
 - Place your input image (e.g., assignment-001-given.jpg) in the project directory.
 - Run the script using Python:
```bash
 python draw_rectangle_text.py
```
 ## The script will:
 - Display the processed image with a green rectangle and overlay text.
 - Save the output image as assignment-001-result.jpg in the project directory.
